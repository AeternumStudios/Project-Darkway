# This is a reward file
# Define rewards in here (Items, commands, etc)
# File name is the reward name, without file extention
# This reward is named "ExampleAdvanced"
# That is what you put as a reward for other plugins, like VotingPlugin
# DO NOT HAVE DUPLICATE NAMES!!
# 
# Wiki Page: 
# https://github.com/Ben12345rocks/AdvancedCore/wiki/Reward-files
# 
# You can just remove values you don't want (just delete it)
# If you just want money just have a reward file containg only "Money: 100", for example
# 
# This is the advanced example, if you only want an item or command then look
# at the basic example, you can simply copy and paste from here what you want
# in other reward files, that is the way they are designed
# 
# This will delay the reward file from running
